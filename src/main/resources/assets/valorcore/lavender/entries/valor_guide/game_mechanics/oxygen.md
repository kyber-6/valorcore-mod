While you usually do not have to worry about oxygen, be mindful of travelling to great heights, for you might find that there, the air runs thin.

---

;;;;;

If you reach a height of Y > 200, you will begin to lose oxygen. When all your oxygen is depleted, so will you begin to fade.

To circumvent this, you can craft an %{item.thinair.air_bladder}% to store fresh oxygen on-the-go.

<recipe;thinair:air_bladder>

;;;;;

Additionally, the %{item.thinair.air_bladder}% can be reinforced to a %{item.thinair.reinforced_air_bladder}%.

<recipe;thinair:reinforced_air_bladder>

;;;;;

One can also craft the equipable %{item.thinair.respirator}%, for a hands-free oxygen delivery device.

<recipe;thinair:respirator>

;;;;;

In case all else fails, one can use a %{item.thinair.soulfire_bottle}% to instantly top up their oxygen supply.

<recipe;thinair:soulfire_bottle>

;;;;;

Finally, the %{item.thinair.safety_lantern}% can be used to check the quality of surrounding air.
