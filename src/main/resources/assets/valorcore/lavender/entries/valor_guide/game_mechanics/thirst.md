In addition to satisfying hunger, you also have to quench your thirst. You can drink water from any water source by holding right-click, but fresh water can only be found in rivers.

;;;;;

A **leather flask** can be crafted to store purified water. Be careful not to mix it with dirty water, otherwise it will become dirty too.

<recipe;dehydration:leather_flask>

;;;;;

The flask can be upgraded to the following tiers.

<recipe;dehydration:iron_leather_flask>

<recipe;dehydration:golden_leather_flask>

;;;;;

<recipe;dehydration:diamond_leather_flask>

<recipe;dehydration:netherite_leather_flask>

Additionally, you can purify water yourself with a number of different methods.

;;;;;

1. Place a **water bottle** onto a campfire to obtain a **purified water bottle**.

2. You can build a **campfire cauldron** to heat up dirty water and purify it. First craft a **copper cauldron**.

<recipe;dehydration:copper_cauldron>

;;;;;

Then, place the **copper cauldron** above a **campfire**.

<structure;valorcore:campfire_cauldron>

;;;;;

Finally, you can make a **bamboo pump**, which pumps out fresh water straight from the ground.

<recipe;dehydration:bamboo_pump>

;;;;;

Simply place the **bamboo pump** on a flat surface, attach an empty bottle or bucket using right-click, right-click to turn on and off the pump, then shift-right-click to obtain your purified water container.
