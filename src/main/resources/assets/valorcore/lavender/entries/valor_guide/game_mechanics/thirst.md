In addition to satisfying hunger, you also have to quench your thirst. You can drink water from any water source by holding right-click, but fresh water can only be found in rivers.

A **leather flask** can be crafted to store purified water. Be careful not to mix it with dirty water, otherwise it will become dirty too.
